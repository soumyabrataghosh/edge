# Greece

## Recommendations by a co-worker

My personal choice is always Naxos, I am on the same side with you: I don’t care about the night life, other than a good choice of restaurants and tavernas. The nice beaches and diversity of local scenery is what interests me and Naxos, as the biggest of the Cyclades islands has everything to offer:

- Sandy beaches, including Agios Prokopios which has been voted in the top 10 beaches of the world (once you step on the golden, powder-like sand, you will see why)
- Traditional Greek mountain villages, like Apeiranthos, which feels like you’re in the mainland instead of an island (you literally have no view of sea from that village)
- Off the beaten path places, like Moutsouna, a seaside small village (40-50 permanent residents) at the other side of the island with graphical taverns and freezing crystal clear waters.

On the same style, if you want something bigger than that, you can never go wrong with Crete: it has everything, and more, it’s just that it’s cities are actually that: cities, which look kinda like Athens and you might not completely feel that “escape vibe”.

In the same lines, but on a completely different geographical and topographical scenery you can try the west side of Greece: Corfu or Kefalonia. Same offerings with Naxos, but with a lot of greenery (Cyclades and the Aegean Sea in general have more rocky, dry climate islands) and, really, emerald waters.

Have a look on Google for pictures of these islands and see what looks more appealing. I think you will find something nice :
