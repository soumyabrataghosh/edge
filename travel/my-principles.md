# My Principles

* Don't travel for ego, desire, comfort or money.
* Travel for learning and experiencing a different culture. Open your heart to learning from others. Everyone knows something you don't know.
* Have roadmates that you are together for having fun and exploring around, not for financial goals.
* Leave no trace. 
* Respect and adopt to other cultures.
* Share mutually. Sharing is giving without expecting. Don't take advantage of others. Be ethical when you share and watch out for others if they are happy to share. .
* Patriotic and religious bullshit is not welcomed. Don't argue with locals about their views or choices.
* Everyone is equal. Noone is superior than others.
