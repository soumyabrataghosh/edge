## How to hitchhike to islands and overseas?

* Learn how trade is done between where you are and your destination.
* If it's an island, hi 4-5 hours away, hitchhike with commercial trucks getting on boat to that island. This works perfectly in Indonesia, we hitchiked from Java to Flores in 5 days last August.
