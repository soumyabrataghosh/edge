## Tarhana

### What is tarhana ?

Trahanas (Τραχανάς) or tarhana is dried food ingredient based on a fermented mixture of grain and yoghurt or fermented milk found in the cuisines of Southeast Europe and Middle East. Dry tarhana has a texture of coarse, uneven crumbs, and it is usually made into a thick soup with water, stock, or milk.
