## Editing

#### How to remove lens dirt ? 

* Open Adobe Photoshop
* Select `Spot Healing Brush Tool` and brush the dirt to remove it.
* If not effective, select the area with Patch Tool and around to find the pattern that matches the area you want to fix.

#### How to do area specific color corrections in Lightroom ?

* Select `Adjustment Brush`
* Enable `Show Mask Overlay` so you see the area you selected.
* Use the brush tool to select the areas you wanna fix.
* Apply the fix.

#### What should be fixed in a regular shot ?

* **Rotation:** Make sure it looks straight. 
* **Frame**: The frame should have good focus and be free from unnecessary distractions.
* **Light:** +/- basic settings such as `exposure` and `shadows` to make sure the photo doesn't hurt eyes.
* **Colors**: Colors make people enjoy seeing a photo. +/- following basic settings;
  * +/- Contrast
  * +/- Saturation
  * +/- Temperature
  
## Ethics

* If you're taking photo of people, always get their permission.
* Don't delete or add any objects.
* Shoot as it is, don't manipulate or influence people's mood, behavior or emotions to get the shot you want. For example, during I was volunteering in the Syrian border, I've seen a lot of parasite journalists who specifically look for shocking photos, and even manipulate refugees' mood so they can the kind of shot when want.
