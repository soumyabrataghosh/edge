# The Sunnah Paradox

I'm raised as Muslim and spent a lot of time thinking about it during my life. My relationship with Islam has been an adventure, sometimes hated and abandoned it, sometimes loved it. Traveling in Asia and Africa, learning about other cultures which influenced Islamic culture, now I realized that I shouldn't rush to come to conclusions about it. Thinking is joyful when you don't rush for conclusions.

Because it's more complex than we think. Take sunnah for example, one of the core concepts of islam. It says, we are required to follow Muhammad. When you tell this to people, they take it as "repeating". Whatever he did, we need to repeat. He did extra pray on evenings, ok we should also do that, he liked cats, ok we also like cats (true example, notice how street cats are treated in Islamic countries).

But there is one thing Muhammad did; he refused the heritage of his time's society and made a revolution. He didn't repeat anything. So should we also follow him on refusing the heritage completely ? If we little bit do, we could open room for a lot of changes on Islam.
