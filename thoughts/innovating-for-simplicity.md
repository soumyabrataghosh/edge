## Innovating for Simplicity

I've been using an old classic Casio watch since when I was kid. First I had the plastic one, later I switched to the metalic color. Once I lost it in the airport, then I got the same model for only 30 Lira (About $7.5).
This Casio watch is superior than most of the technology we got in these days. Why did I say this? Here are the reasons;

* It's simple
* It's fast
* It can run for 20 years with same battery
* It won't distract you
* It can be repaired easily
* You don't have to upgrade to next model every year

Some of these items are hard to have in smartphones and computers. For example, we haven't invented a long lasting battery yet.
What about the other ones in the list though? If we think about simplicity, speed and distraction, why the new technologies suck at these fundamental features?

In 2017, technology companies create habit teams to research and develop ways to make users more addicted to use their thrash apps, so a user who just wants
to check the time ends up looking at his highschool friend's vacation photos 15 minutes after. We can't expect these growth vampires profiting from manipulating
people to innovate new technology for the benefit of humanity.
