# Time

Time is the energy of the universe. You give it some energy, it gets some stuff done. For example, Give the earth half a year, it can grow a tree. Give two humans 9 months, they can make another human.

Our journey begins with time. The earth turns around the sun for itself and for us, giving every single of us a new day. When we observe then nature, we see their rituals of celebrating a new morning, a new season, similar to humans. We all appreciate and celebrate the time. Because it's given to all of us equally, and it's completely free by its nature.
