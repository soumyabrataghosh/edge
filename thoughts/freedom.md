# Freedom

Recently I've been thinking about freedom from the moral perspective. A question that I had to ask myself is, how should freedom be spent in a responsible way ?

If we look at the free creatures in the wild, they survive by organizing their whole life based on where they find the food. In the other words, every individual in the nature is free *only if* they find their *own* food. A monkey wakes up in the jungle, jumps to the river and swims little bit just for his own pleasure, then finds some food to eat. A horse runs with his friends with great joy to find food. A crowd of birds fly by dancing from Africa all the way to Turkey every spring to find food and chill. This is true freedom; surviving independently with the harmony of pleasure, suffer, uncertanity and risks.

I've been going through a self isolation. A sudden strong emotion state that makes you feel stranger to your environment. . I guess I needed to witness the madness of people filling the life with comfort and pleasure. I've been trying to gather my mind and sharpen my focus to find my path.
