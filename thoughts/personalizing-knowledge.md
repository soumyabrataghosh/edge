# Personalizing Knowledge

Did you have a piggybank when you were kid ? I remember walking into a clothing store, holding my mom's hand. I bought some fancy clothes with my savings
when I was 4 years old. At that age, I only needed one piggy bank for one purpose; money. As an adult today, I have a wallet and bank accounts,
but now need piggy bank for other things; knowledge for example.

For ages, we received knowledge from books. We loved books, some people called their books as "best friends forever"", or gave them as gifts.
We built libraries just for keeping books. We walked into our friend's house
and checked their library. That gave us an idea about our friend's personality, because we were inside their "knowledge piggybank".

Internet is changing everything. Now we receive most of our knowledge from digital screens, instead of books. We have the best technologies for
receiving the knowledge, how about for filtering, processing and organizing the knowledge though ? When we walk into a library, we have options.
When we walk into internet, search engines selects "the best knowledge" and we walk away with whatever we can get. It's comfortable, but do we even trust
search engines? Let's say we found some excellent knowledge, how do we attach that into our existing knowledge ? How do we personalize it ? And most importantly,
how do we keep the source somewhere like our personal library, so we can access them easily next time we need it ?

Last year, I lost my notebook that I kept for years. It included things like draft poems, notes from the books I read, etc. It was quite valuable for me and I lost
it. I remember myself thinking like "There is no way to recover that, so, what's next?". The next was a fresh start for me, I started two digital and physical notebooks
at same time. My digital notebook is on Github and it's publicly available for anyone. Anything I don't wanna forget is there; list of wild weed growing around my hometown,
list of words I learn, quotes from favorite authors, food recipes, list of items I need in my backpack when I travel, random thoughts, some info I need for my work, everything.
This notebook is safe but most importantly, it helps me to create my personal library where I process the knowledge I receive. I categorize them as files,
so related information are next to eachother. That's how two different knowledge in same category gets attached to eachother, like two similar books in a bookshelf.
Digital notebooks are very useful and I highly recommend everyone to have one, but they are not an alternative for hard copy notebooks.

In additional to the digital notebooks, I have two hard copy notebooks. I keep a medium size notebook in my desk and keep information that needs to be well organized. And
I have a pocket notebook that I can carry everywhere and write things quickly without organizing. For example, when I meet someone new and learn something valuable,
I write it in my pocket notebook before copying it to other places later times. Imagine you're getting list of valuable info from someone and you open up your phone to
take notes, but your battery is low, or you got 15 unread Whatsapp messages; mobile phones are the worst places to keep notes. Physical notebooks help you
take your notes without distracting, so you can focus on the knowledge you're receiving.
