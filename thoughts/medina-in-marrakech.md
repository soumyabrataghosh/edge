# medina in marrakech


have you watched morning routine of birds ? they get together every sunrise time and hunt together above beautiful rocks on a sea or ocean coast. I loved watching their life in Point Reyes and Big Sur. Economy is good for the fishes because the sea is rich, even a broken bridge becomes food for them. Earth is magical.
