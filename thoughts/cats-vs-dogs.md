# Cats vs Dogs

Relationship with a dog is very simple and annoying because the dog never see you as friend. It'll love you the whole time no matter if you're treating it good or bad. Unfortunately, dogs see humans superior than them, and they even let humans control their whole life.

In contrast, cats won't love you unconditionally. It'll be a complicated relationship depending on both sides attitude and mood. They won't let you control their life because they don't see humans superior than them.
