# Surviving Fairly

one day I gave two kids some small gifts because I liked them. their auntie saw us and invited to have tea. we met the whole family, had tea. I'm talking about may be 50 cups of tea. we don't even speak the same language but we tell eachother stories, we are connected.

We were in Alaska 1.5 year ago, knocked a random door in a native village, ended up meeting all the family, had lunch together, listened their stories, learnt a lot of stuff about how Mentasta indians dealt colonialist occupation; probably the biggest robbery in the world history. .

I got sick in Indonesia last summer, my body was fucked up. We kept walking, for hours. Then my body shut down, I slept for hours under a tree not being able to open my eyes. We found a village, Nova asked someone to help us. They invited me to their home and cooked food. I could walk more, we made it to Wae Rebo by walking, and a woman tourist from New Zeeland with medicine and basic tools helped me to recover that night.

One of the moments I felt closest to death was last october in Toubkal, second highest peak in Africa. We got caught weak and unprepared by stormy weather, strong enough to hit 4 adults on the ground. We made it to peak walking near cliffs. How we survived? By staying together with two other strangers and holding eachother's hands. .

The world is full of wonderful people who will welcome and share with you expecting nothing. We need to get out of the mindset of both fear and competition. We're neither fighting nor racing, we are surviving together. Someone made my notebook, another made my pencil. No matter I paid for both, it's only ethical if I use that pencil and notebook to write things that don't upset them. you're not superior because you got money, power or good education. You have that nice car and house but you didn't make both, people sacrificed from their lives and worked hard to make them for you. Is it fair if you think you're superior than someone made your clothes? Your money doesn't worth anything if other people don't sacrifice time. We survive together as one, and it's only ethical if when we do it fairly. üëãüèº
