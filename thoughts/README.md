## Thoughts

Hey there,

Most of the thoughts here are outdated. I was lucky enough to be able to go deeper on various topics,
observe more details, and evolve my mind with better filters. 

I changed my mind a lot.

And I'm also putting a lot of effort to get rid of the scatter in my mind. I deleted my social media accounts, 
 stopped following news, switched to a dumbphone. 
 
So, these thoughts belong to me, but a younger version of me. Hopefully I'll write stuff that I can look back and not feel embarrassed.
