# Commitment vs Consensus

### Commitment
* empowers teams
* helps teams help them focus on the problem
* helps teams develop creative solutions.
* makes people feel comfortable to make quick decisions, experiment ideas, and learn from mistakes.

### Consensus
* drives teams/individuals make choices with confirmation bias.
* distracts teams with unproductive participations
* enables politics by creating the need for verification. 
* empowers people with status.
* makes people afraid to make mistakes, so they overanalyze and often postpone.
* creates need for immediate & sync communication. Thus, people follow Slack channels all day as they don't want to miss any important conversation.
