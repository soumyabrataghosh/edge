# Joshua Tree

I was in Joshua Tree a month ago and thought “these cactus plants don’t need a lot of water, but they grow and they’re persistent”.    Creating a way of living that depends on little amount of “water” (money, or funding) is actually equal to having a lot of “water”. In the other words, if we actually liberate the society from needing a lot of “water” by improving the minimum living standard, it’ll be the same thing with having millions of dollars invested on community projects. Sorry if my english is limiting me. What I wanna say is we need a land that gives us much less water but enough to be free, so we can build our projects…

A part of the society demand an economic system that doesn’t need a lot of “water” (money) but it’s distributed in such a way that is enough for letting a lot of plants (people) grow and be persistent.
