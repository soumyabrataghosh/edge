## apples, birds and beauty

Groceries nowadays have perfect looking apples because the farmers started using medicine to keep the birds away from biting their apples. No matter how much they bite, we don't want them to touch "our" apples. Why ? The nature has such a meaningful balance; birds take small bites, humans come and grab the rest. It's the same taste, except apples with bird bites look different. They don't fit the beauty standard set by popular movies. People want their ikea table to have plasic looking untouched apples. To me though, an apple with some bird bites on it look a lot more beautiful honestly. When we take it from the tree, we see the art of the nature on it. All those random patterns... That's the beauty of the nature.
