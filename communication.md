# Grice's Maxims

* **The maxim of quantity**, where one tries to be as informative as one possibly can, and gives as much information as is needed, and no more.
* **The maxim of quality**, where one tries to be truthful, and does not give information that is false or that is not supported by evidence.
* **The maxim of relation**, where one tries to be relevant, and says things that are pertinent to the discussion.
* **The maxim of manner**, when one tries to be as clear, as brief, and as orderly as one can in what one says, and where one avoids obscurity and ambiguit

# Feedback

## Giving Feedback

* Talk openly: be comfortable with uncomfortable.
* Don't let fear dictate you.
* Ask the receiver if it's good time to give feedback, before giving it.
* Follow **"Data Driven Feedback"** framework:
  * Present concrete data to the receiver
  * Explain the impact
  * Propose actions
* Don't judge, don't try to fix the receiver
* Explain your feelings; "this is how it came across to me"
* "Here's what you should do" -> "Here is what I'd do"
* Be conscious of timing
* Focus on behavior, not character

#### Reinforcing Feedback

The kind of feedback that recognizes and emphasizes the positive actions. Examples:

* "Good job"
* "You have positive impact on..."

#### Redirecting Feedback

The feedback kind requesting to stop X and start Y from the receiver. Redirecting feedbacks should be actionable, and receiver should know what went well and what did not.

## Receiving Feedback

> Perception is all there is â€• Tom Peters

* Control your defensiveness. Let other side feel welcomed to give feedback.
* Framework:
  * Active listening: Let the other person talk until done. Pay good attention, look at the person talking.
  * Reflection: Verify and build up reasoning. Ask "Why?". 
  * Action: ask the question "Is there something I can do to improve?"
