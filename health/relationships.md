## Better Conversation Advices

Noted from the [TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/celeste_headlee_10_ways_to_have_a_better_conversation) I watched and liked a lot.

#### Don’t Multitask
Be present, be in that moment. Don’t be half in, half out.

#### Don’t pontificate
If you want to state your opinion without any opportunity to response, write a blog. Everyone you will ever meet, knows something you don’t.

#### Use Open Ended Questions
Start your [question]() with Who, Where and When. If you ask complicated questions like “Were you terrified?” you’ll get a simple answer like “yes”. Let them describe. Ask “how was it like?”

#### Go With The Flow
Thoughts will come into your mind, you need to let them go. Don’t let thoughts make you stop listening.

#### If you don’t know, say that you don’t know.
Talk should not be cheated.

#### Don’t equate your experience with theirs
If they talk about a trouble at work, don’t tell them how much you hate your job. It’s never the same. All experiences are individual. More importantly, it’s not about you, it’s about them. Conversations are not promotional opportunity.

#### Try not to repeat yourself
It’s condescending. Don’t repurchase same thing over and over.

#### Stay out of the weeds
People don’t care about details like date, location. They care about you. Forget the details.

#### Listen
Most of us don’t listen with the intent to understand, we listen with the intent to reply.

#### Be Brief
A good conversation is like miniskirt, short enough to retain interest, but long enough to cover the subject.

## Friendship

Seneca [writes in his letters](https://www.brainpickings.org/2017/05/19/seneca-friendship/):

> One who seeks friendship for favourable occasions, strips it of all its nobility.

> If you consider any man a friend whom you do not trust as you trust yourself, you are mightily mistaken and you do not sufficiently understand what true friendship means… When friendship is settled, you must trust; before friendship is formed, you must pass judgment. Those persons indeed put last first and confound their duties, who … judge a man after they have made him their friend, instead of making him their friend after they have judged him. Ponder for a long time whether you shall admit a given person to your friendship; but when you have decided to admit him, welcome him with all your heart and soul. Speak as boldly with him as with yourself… Regard him as loyal and you will make him loyal.

## Reasons To Say No

Quoted from [Jocelyn Glei](https://twitter.com/jkglei/status/934103114566766594)

* Not aligned with your goals/audience.
* Not relevant to your expertise and/or interests.
* Not an authentic invitation. (They didn't take the time to understand what you do.)


## The Three Things I Look For in a Person

> “You’re looking for three things, generally, in a person,” says Buffett. “Intelligence, energy, and integrity. And if they don’t have the last one, don’t even bother with the first two. I tell them, ‘Everyone here has the intelligence and energy—you wouldn’t be here otherwise. But the integrity is up to you. You weren’t born with it, you can’t learn it in school.”

> “You decide to be dishonest, stingy, uncharitable, egotistical, all the things people don’t like in other people,” argues Warren. “They are all choices. Some people think there’s a limited little pot of admiration to go around, and anything the other guy takes out of the pot, there’s less left for you. But it’s just the opposite.”
