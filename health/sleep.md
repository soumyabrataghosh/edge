# Sleep

## What are the stages of sleep?

Sleep is divided into two categories: REM and non-REM sleep. You begin the night in non-REM sleep followed by a brief period of REM sleep. The cycle continues throughout the night about every 90 minutes.

Deep sleep occurs in the final stage of non-REM sleep.

## Non-REM sleep

Stage 1 of non-REM sleep lasts several minutes as you move from being awake to being asleep.

#### During stage 1:

* your body functions — like heartbeat, respiration, and eye movements — begin to slow
* your muscles relax with only occasional twitches
* your brain waves start to slow down from their wakeful state


Stage 2 accounts for about 50 percentTrusted Source of the total sleep cycle. This is the stage of sleep you may fall into more than any other throughout the night.

#### During stage 2:

* your body’s systems continue to slow and relax
* your core temperature drops
* your eye movements stop
* your brain waves are slow, but you have some short bursts of activity

Stages 3 and 4 are when you experience deep sleep.

#### During these stages:

* your heartbeat and breathing become their slowest as your muscles relax
* your brain waves become the slowest they’ll be while you’re asleep
* it’s difficult to awaken even with loud noises

Deep sleep is also referred to as “slow wave sleep” (SWS) or delta sleep.

The first stage of deep sleep lasts anywhere from 45 to 90 minutes. It lasts for longer periods in the first half of the night and becomes shorter with each sleep cycle.

## REM sleep

Stage 5, or your first stage of REM sleep, occurs about 90 minutes after moving through non-REM stages.

#### During this stage:

* your eyes move rapidly from side to side
* you experience dreaming as your brain activity increases to a more wakeful state
* your heart rate increases to near its wakeful state
* your breathing becomes faster and even irregular at times
* your limbs may even become paralyzed

## Benefits of Deep Sleep

Glucose metabolism in the brain increases during deep sleep, supporting short-term and long-term memory and overall learning.

Deep sleep is also when the pituitary gland secretes important hormones, like human growth hormone, leading to growth and development of the body.

Other benefits of deep sleep include:

* energy restoration
* cell regeneration
* increasing blood supply to muscles
* promoting growth and repair of tissues and bones
* strengthening the immune system

# How to get better sleep ?

* Power down bright lights/screen time at least an hour before bed. We mean it. We all have busy lives and our phones, tablets, computers and TVs call us for work or play 24⁄7. Removing the bright light and the stimulation will help ready your body for its sleep cycle.
* Stick to a similar bedtime every night – even on weekends. Better deep sleep is about becoming a better creature of habit. It doesn’t mean five days on and two days off. Keeping a consistent pattern for your body helps it stay in alignment and find the right cycle night after night.
* Find the right temperature for your bedroom. Some like it hot. Some like it cold. But physiology and science agree that the right median temperature for a body to rest at night is right around 67 degrees Fahrenheit (19.5 degrees Celsius).
* No big meals or workouts too close to bedtime. We all live active lives and are pressed for time to hit the gym or eat before hitting the sack and starting a new day. But the effects of these active or ravenous nights are shown to disrupt sleep, and thus decrease the amount of deep sleep we get. Some say it’s best to avoid workouts and heavy meals 3 hours before bedtime.
* De-stress. Easier said than done, of course. However, as you reduce your stress – whether through the help of meditation, stretching, acupuncture or lifestyle shifts – you can calm your mind and body and give yourself a higher chance at a better night’s rest.
