## 5 ways to build lasting self-esteem

Noted from [Ted Ideas](http://ideas.ted.com/5-ways-to-build-lasting-self-esteem)

Improving self-esteem requires a bit of work, as it involves developing and maintaining healthier emotional habits but doing so, and especially doing so correctly, will provide a great emotional and psychological return on your investment.

#### Use positive affirmations correctly

Ironically, positive affirmations do work for one subset of people — those whose self-esteem is already high. For affirmations to work when your self-esteem is lagging, tweak them to make them more believable. For example, change “I’m going to be a great success!” to “I’m going to persevere until I succeed!”

#### Identify your competencies and develop them

Self-esteem is built by demonstrating real ability and achievement in areas of our lives that matter to us.

#### Learn to accept compliments

The best way to avoid the reflexive reactions of batting away compliments is to prepare simple set responses and train yourself to use them automatically whenever you get good feedback (e.g., “Thank you” or “How kind of you to say”).

#### Eliminate self-criticism and introduce self-compassion

Whenever your self-critical inner monologue kicks in, ask yourself what you would say to a dear friend if they were in your situation and direct those comments to yourself.

#### Affirm your real worth

Make a list of qualities you have that are meaningful in the specific context.

## 25 Principles of Adult Behavior by John Perry Barlow

* Be patient. No matter what.
* Don’t badmouth: Assign responsibility, never blame. Say nothing behind another’s back you’d be unwilling to say, in exactly the same tone and language, to his face.
* Never assume the motives of others are, to them, less noble than yours are to you.
* Expand your sense of the possible.
* Don’t trouble yourself with matters you truly cannot change.
* Expect no more of anyone than you yourself can deliver.
* Tolerate ambiguity.
* Laugh at yourself frequently.
* Concern yourself with what is right rather than who is right.
* Never forget that, no matter how certain, you might be wrong.
* Give up blood sports.
* Remember that your life belongs to others as well. Do not endanger it frivolously. And never endanger the life of another.
* Never lie to anyone for any reason. (Lies of omission are sometimes exempt.)
* Learn the needs of those around you and respect them.
* Avoid the pursuit of happiness. Seek to define your mission and pursue that.
* Reduce your use of the first personal pronoun.
* Praise at least as often as you disparage.
* Never let your errors pass without admission.
* Become less suspicious of joy.
* Understand humility.
* Forgive.
* Foster dignity.
* Live memorably.
* Love yourself.
* Endure.
