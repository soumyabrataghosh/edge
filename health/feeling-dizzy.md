# Feeling Dizzy

I started feeling dizzy more often. Below is some information I collected via Google searches.

#### Top 5 reasons you might feel woozy

* **Dehydration:** You may become dehydrated if you're overheated, if you aren't eating or drinking enough, or if you're sick. Without enough fluids, the volume of your blood goes down, lowering your blood pressure and keeping your brain from getting enough blood, causing lightheadedness.
* **Sudden drop in blood pressure:** The autonomic nervous system helps the body regulate the shift in blood pressure when we stand up. As we get older, this system may deteriorate, causing a temporary drop in blood pressure when we stand—known as orthostatic hypotension—resulting in lightheadedness. 
* **Low blood sugar:** "When you don't have enough blood sugar, every system in your body goes on reserve to use as little energy as possible, including your brain, making you feel lightheaded or confused," says Dr. Grossman. It may only take a drink of juice to relieve your symptoms, but it's best to get your blood sugar levels checked, especially if you need more glucose (sugar) in intravenous or pill form.
* **Heart attack and stroke:** At its most serious, lightheadedness may be a sign of a heart attack or stroke. 
* **Neck Muscle Pain:** Sometimes dizziness is caused by severely tight neck muscles. After confirming your situation with a professional, treatment usually involves physical therapy, hot/cold treatment, or medication.
