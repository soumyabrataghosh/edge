## Development of Baby

#### First trimester (Week 1-12)

At four to five weeks:

* Your baby's brain and spinal cord have begun to form.
* The heart begins to form.
* Arm and leg buds appear.
* Your baby is now an embryo and one-twenty-fifth inch long.

At eight weeks:

* All major organs and external body structures have begun to form.
* Your baby's heart beats with a regular rhythm.
* The arms and legs grow longer, and fingers and toes have begun to form.
* The sex organs begin to form.
* The eyes have moved forward on the face and eyelids have formed.
* The umbilical cord is clearly visible.
* At the end of eight weeks, your baby is a fetus and looks more like a human. Your baby is nearly 1 inch long and weighs less than one-eighth ounce.

At 12 weeks:

* The nerves and muscles begin to work together. Your baby can make a fist.
* The external sex organs show if your baby is a boy or girl. A woman who has an ultrasound in the second trimester or later might be able to find out the baby's sex.
* Eyelids close to protect the developing eyes. They will not open again until the 28th week.
* Head growth has slowed, and your baby is much longer. Now, at about 3 inches long, your baby weighs almost an ounce.

#### Second Trimester (Week 13-Week 28)

At 16 weeks:

* Muscle tissue and bone continue to form, creating a more complete skeleton.
* Skin begins to form. You can nearly see through it.
* Meconium (mih-KOH-nee-uhm) develops in your baby's intestinal tract. This will be your baby's first bowel movement.
* Your baby makes sucking motions with the mouth (sucking reflex).
* Your baby reaches a length of about 10-12cm and weighs almost 85 grams.

At 20 weeks:

* Your baby is more active. You might feel slight fluttering.
* Your baby is covered by fine, downy hair called lanugo (luh-NOO-goh) and a waxy coating called vernix. This protects the forming skin underneath.
* Eyebrows, eyelashes, fingernails, and toenails have formed. Your baby can even scratch itself.
* Your baby can hear and swallow.
* Now halfway through your pregnancy, your baby is about 6 inches long and weighs about 9 ounces.

At 24 weeks:

* Bone marrow begins to make blood cells.
* Taste buds form on your baby's tongue.
* Footprints and fingerprints have formed.
* Real hair begins to grow on your baby's head.
* The lungs are formed, but do not work.
* The hand and startle reflex develop.
* Your baby sleeps and wakes regularly.
* If your baby is a boy, his testicles begin to move from the abdomen into the scrotum. If your baby is a girl, her uterus and ovaries are in place, and a lifetime supply of eggs have formed in the ovaries.
* Your baby stores fat and has gained quite a bit of weight. Now at about 12 inches long, your baby weighs about 1½ pounds.

#### Third Trimester

At 32 weeks:

* Your baby's bones are fully formed, but still soft.
* Your baby's kicks and jabs are forceful.
* The eyes can open and close and sense changes in light.
* Lungs are not fully formed, but practice "breathing" movements occur.
* Your baby's body begins to store vital minerals, such as iron and calcium.
* Lanugo begins to fall off.
* Your baby is gaining weight quickly, about one-half pound a week. Now, your baby is about 15 to 17 inches long and weighs about 4 to 4½ pounds.

At 36 weeks:

* The protective waxy coating called vernix gets thicker.
* Body fat increases. Your baby is getting bigger and bigger and has less space to move around. Movements are less forceful, but you will feel stretches and wiggles.
* Your baby is about 16 to 19 inches long and weighs about 6 to 6½ pounds.

Weeks 37-40:

* By the end of 37 weeks, your baby is considered full term. Your baby's organs are ready to function on their own.
* As you near your due date, your baby may turn into a head-down position for birth. Most babies "present" head down.
* At birth, your baby may weigh somewhere between 6 pounds 2 ounces and 9 pounds 2 ounces and be 19 to 21 inches long. Most full-term babies fall within these ranges. But healthy babies come in many different sizes.
