## Newborn Baby

Our baby is one week old by now. Here is what I learnt so far;

* Infants can detect light but can not "see" first 2 weeks. They'll be able to make eye contact and focus on objects by the end of month.
* They need sun bathing every day at least for 30 minutes between 6am until 9am.
* Swaddling is not beneficial according to the experts.
* They need milk every 2 hours and they'll cry until you feed them. 
* When baby is crying and you want to make him/her feel comfortable, try [burping](https://www.babycentre.co.uk/a1051322/how-to-burp-your-baby).
* Even normal birth is bloody like a surgery. The mother will keep having painful contractions and will need a lot of rest after birth, so the father has to be ready for hard work and sleepless nights. 
* Disposable diapers are comfortable for baby because they can keep sleeping after peeing, so the parents, too. But they're expensive. We use clothe diapers and wake up & change when the baby pee/poo, and do laundry every day. 

## Feeding

Infants ask for more food than they need. It's helpful to know the best amount and frequency to avoid overfeeding.

| Age | Amount | Time Period |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Newborn | 45-90 ml | Every 2-3 Hours |
| 2 Months | 120-150 ml | Every 3-4 Hours |
| 4 Months | 120-180 ml | * |
| 6 Months | 180-230 | ** |

\* Depends on the frequency of feedings and his or her size

\** Depends on whether you've introduced any baby food.

## Vomitting

It's a sign for overfeeding (if there is no other issue). We started using a pacifier once our baby puked after drinking a lot of milk.

## Fever

Normal body temperature for a baby is 36.4°C, it can vary slightly. 38°C degree and above is considered as fewer.

## Crying

* Crying increases at 2 or 3 weeks of age, peaks between 6 and 8 weeks, and then slows down after that, generally hitting its lowest level by around 4 months. 
* When the baby cries a lot, try singing a lullaby. It works magically. 
* They might have gas, as a part of the body development. Try making them feel comfortable by [burping](https://www.babycentre.co.uk/a1051322/how-to-burp-your-baby).
