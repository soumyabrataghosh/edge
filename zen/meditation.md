## Zazen Posture

* When you sit in the full position, your left foot is on your right thigh, and your right foot is on your left thigh.
* Keep your spine straight.
* Your ears and your shoulders should be on one line. 
* Relax your shoulders, push up towards the ceiling with the back of your head.
* Pull your chin in.
* Press your diaphragm down towards your hara, or lower abdomen.
* Your hands should form the "cosmic mudra". Put your left hand on top of your right, middle joints of your middle fighers together, and touch your thumbs lightly together.

## Breathing 

* When we inhale, the air comes into the inner world. When we exhale, the air goes out to the outer world. The inner world is limitless, and the outer world is also limitless. We say “inner world” or “outer world,” but actually there is just one whole world. In this limitless world, our throat is like a swinging door.

## Controlling Thoughts

From [Dogen](https://github.com/azer/notebook/blob/master/books/the-essential-dogen.md):

* Sit solidly in samadhi and think not thinking. How do you think not thinking? Beyond thinking. This is the art of zazen. Zazen is not learning to do concentration. It is the dharma gate of great ease and joy. It is undivided practice-realization.

From [Shunryu Suzuki](https://github.com/azer/notebook/blob/master/books/zen-mind-beginners-mind.md):

* Even though you try to put people under some control, it is impossible. You cannot do it. The best way to control people is to encourage them to be mischievous.
* Then they will be in control in its wider sense. To give your sheep or cow a large, spacious meadow is the way to control him. So it is with people: first let them do what they want, and watch them. This is the best policy. To ignore them is not good; that is the worst policy. The second worst is trying to control them. The best one is to watch them, just to watch them, without trying to control them.
* The same way works for you yourself as well. If you want to obtain perfect calmness in your zazen, you should not be bothered by the various images you find in your mind.
* Suppose you are sitting under some extraordinary circumstances. If you try to calm your mind you will be unable to sit, and if you try not to be disturbed, your effort will not be the right effort. The only effort that will help you is to count your breathing, or to concentrate on your inhaling and exhaling. We say concentration, but to concentrate your mind on something is not the true purpose of Zen. The true purpose is to see things as they are, to observe things as they are, and to let everything go as it goes. This is to put everything under control in its widest sense.
* When you are practicing zazen, do not try to stop your thinking. Let it stop by itself. If something comes into your mind, let it come in, and let it go out. It will not stay long.
* Usually we think of our mind as receiving impressions and experiences from outside, but that is not a true understanding of our mind. The true understanding is that the mind includes everything; when you think something comes from outside it means only that something appears in your mind. Nothing outside yourself can cause any trouble. You yourself make the waves in your mind. If you leave your mind as it is, it will become calm.
* Even though waves arise, the essence of your mind is pure; it is just like clear water with a few waves. Actually water always has waves. Waves are the practice of the water. To speak of waves apart from water or water apart from waves is a delusion. Water and waves are one.
