## Ten Prohibitory Precepts

* Not to kill. 
* Not to steal. 
* Not to misuse sex.
* Not to make false statements. 
* Not to sell or buy alcohol.
* Not to discuss the faults of other home-leaver bodhisattvas. 
* Not to praise yourself and insult others.
* Not to withhold dharma treasure. 
* Not to be angry.
* Not to slander the three treasures. 

P.S Loving fame is worse than breaking a precept.

## Birth and death

* Life is often called “birth” in Buddhism, since a person is seen as being born and dying many times at each moment. Thus birth and death are experienced not in opposition but as one. To indicate this unity, we sometimes translate them as birth-and-death. In meditation one may experience a state beyond birth and beyond death.
* “Emancipation” means that in birth you are emancipated from birth and in death you are emancipated from death.
* In birth there is nothing but birth, and in death there is nothing but death. Accordingly, when birth comes, face and actualize birth, and when death comes, face and actualize death. Do not avoid them or desire them.
* Karma is a Sanskrit word meaning an action and its visible and invisible effect. Dogen had a deep belief that any action can become a cause that brings forth an effect sooner or later.
