# Zen Philosophy

## Beginner's Mind (初心)

* If your mind is empty, it is always ready for anything; it is open to everything. In the beginner’s mind there are many possibilities; in the expert’s mind there are few.

## Creation

There are 3 kinds of creation:

* **Universe:** When you are there, everything else is there; everything is created all at once. When we emerge from nothing, when everything emerges from nothing, we see it all as a fresh new creation. This is nonattachment.
* **Productivity:** Cooking food or tea, building a furniture...
* **Ourself:** Creating within yourself, Education, culture..

## Time 

> Time goes from present to past.
— Dōgen-zenji

* Time is experienced in a paradoxical way in meditation. Dogen’s investigation of time was unique in ancient times. It is also useful for everyday life in the contemporary world. For Dogen, time is inseparable from self, from existence, and from space. Time is being. Time is no other than “time being.”
* The reason you do not clearly understand the time being is that you think of time only as passing.
* At the time the mountains were climbed and the rivers crossed, you were present. Time is not separate from you, and as you are present, time does not go away.
* Mountains are time. Oceans are time. If they were not time, there would be no mountains or oceans.
* Moment after moment each one of us repeats this activity. Here there is no idea of time or space. Time and space are one. You may say, “I must do something this afternoon,” but actually there is no “this afternoon.” We do things one after the other. That is all.

## Practice

> Miracles are nothing other than fetching water and carrying firewood.
— Layman Pangyun

* We should find perfect existence through imperfect existence.
* When we practice zazen we limit our activity to the smallest extent.
* When you bow, you should just bow; when you sit, you should just sit; when you eat, you should just eat. If you do this, the universal nature is there.
* Pleasure is not different from difficulty. Good is not different from bad. Bad is good; good is bad.
* In activity there should be calmness, and in calmness there should be activity. Calmness and activity are not different.

## Communication

> When you say something to someone, he may not accept it, but do not try to make him understand it intellectually. Do not argue with him; just listen to his objections until he himself finds something wrong with them.
— Dōgen-zenji

* When you listen to someone, you should give up all your preconceived ideas and your subjective opinions; you should just listen to him, just observe what his way is. We put very little emphasis on right and wrong or good and bad. We just see things as they are with him, and accept them.
* Usually when you listen to some statement, you hear it as a kind of echo of yourself. You are actually listening to your own opinion.

## Mindfulness 

* The important thing in our understanding is to have a smooth, free-thinking way of observation. We have to think and to observe things without stagnation. We should accept things as they are without difficulty. Our mind should be soft and open enough to understand things as they are. When our thinking is soft, it is called imperturbable thinking. This kind of thinking is always stable. It is called mindfulness. Thinking which is divided in many ways is not true thinking. Concentration should be present in our thinking. This is mindfulness.

## Freedom

* Freedom in Zen practice is not to do whatever one wants but to break through the seeming boundaries of subject and object as well as the distinctions between delusion and enlightenment that hinder us from the realization of things as they are.


## Enlightenment

* Enlightenment is like the moon reflected on the water. The moon does not get wet, nor is the water broken. Although its light is wide and great, the moon is reflected even in a puddle an inch wide.
* Enlightenment does not divide you, just as the moon does not break the water.
* Great enlightenment is the tea and rice of daily activity.
