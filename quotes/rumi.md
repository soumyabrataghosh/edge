# Jalāl ad-Dīn Muhammad Rūmī

> This being human is a guest house. Every morning a new arrival. A joy, a depression, a meanness, some momentary awareness comes as an unexpected visitor. Welcome and entertain them all! Even if they’re a crowd of sorrows, who violently sweep your house empty of its furniture, still, treat each guest honorably. He may be clearing you out for some new delight. The dark thought, the shame, the malice, meet them at the door laughing, and invite them in. Be grateful for whoever comes, because each has been sent as a guide from beyond.

> This is how a human being can change: span there’s a worm addicted to eating grape leaves. Suddenly, he wakes up, Call it grace, whatever, something wakes him, and he’s no longer a worm. He’s the entire vineyard, and the orchard too, the fruit, the trunks, a growing wisdom and joy that doesn’t need to devour.

On difficulty;

> As you start to walk out on the way, the way appears.

On pain and suffering;

> Pain is a treasure, for it contains mercies.

> The cure for pain is in the pain.

> What hurts you, blesses you. Darkness is your candle.

> These pains you feel are messengers. Listen to them.

On comfort and desire;

> The moon stays bright when it doesn't avoid the night.

> Set your life on fire. Seek those who fan your flames.

> Run from what's comfortable. Forget safety. Live where you fear to live. Destroy your reputation. Be notorious.

> All people on the planet are children, except for a very few. No one is grown up except those free of desire.

On beauty;

> Where there is ruin, there is hope for a treasure.

> Let the beauty we love be what we do. There are hundreds of ways to kneel and kiss the ground.

On love;
> Two there are who are never satisfied -- the lover of the world and the lover of knowledge.

> Reason is powerless in the expression of Love.

> A mountain keeps an echo deep inside. That's how I hold your voice.

> Let the lover be disgraceful, crazy, absentminded. Someone sober will worry about things going badly. Let the lover be.

> Love comes with a knife, not some shy question, and not with fears for its reputation!

Advise;

> Start a huge, foolish project, like Noah…it makes absolutely no difference what people think of you.

> Yesterday I was clever, so I wanted to change the world. Today I am wise, so I am changing myself.

> Be like the sun for grace and mercy. Be like the night to cover others' faults. Be like running water for generosity. Be like death for rage and anger. Be like the Earth for modesty. Appear as you are. Be as you appear.

> Only from the heart can you touch the sky.

> Give your weakness to one who helps

أنا الحق (En-el Hak)

> Not only the thirsty seek the water, the water as well seeks the thirsty.

> You are not a drop in the ocean. You are the entire ocean in a drop.

> Your heart is the size of an ocean. Go find yourself in its hidden depths.

> If in thirst you drink water from a cup, you see God in it. Those who are not in love with God will see only their own faces in it.
