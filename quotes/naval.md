Highlights from [Joe Rogan](tps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qHkcs3kG44) podcast.

#### Specialization

* You spend your whole life climbing a mountain, you get two thirds of the way, you see the peak, and now to go to rest of the way, you'll go down to the bottom and look for another path. Nobody wants to do that. Nobody wants to start over. It's very painful to go back down and look for another path, but that may be the best thing to do. That's why when you look at the greatest artists, creators, they have this ability to start over.

#### Social Media

* Rather than really you're looking at yourself, you're looking at how other people look at you, it's like one remote mental image, and it's kind of a disease. Because social media is making celebreties of all of us, and celebreties are the most miserable people in the world. 
* They have this strong self image that gets built up by compliments; every time somebody pays you and me a compliment, and we are like "oh, well thank you!" than that builds up an image of who we are, and one idiot comes along, 1 out of 10 or 1 out of 100, and they can easily tear it down; because it doesn't take many insults to cancel a lot of compliments.
* Now you're carrying around big weighty self-image and it's just very easy to be attacked, and because you're famous or you're well known, people want to attack you, so, being a celebrity is no good, it's actually a problem. 
* You want to be rich and anonymous, not famous and poor.

#### Wealth Creation

* There are 3 things everybody wants; everybody wants to be wealthy, everybody wants to be happy, everybody wants to be fit.
* You don't want to be the guy who succeeds in life while being high strong high stress and unhappy, leaving a trail of emotional wreckage with you and your loved ones. 
* You want to be the person who gets there calmly. 
* When there is a crisis, you want to be the calmest coolest person who still figures out the correct answer. 

#### Happiness

* Desire is a contract to be unhappy until you get what you want.
