# Image Search SaaS

Like Algolia, but for images, powered by computer vision.

## Startup Checklist

#### Who are the users?

- Content Teams working with big image sets
- Developers building search for user uploaded images

#### What is the essence of their dissatisfaction? If they read this answer, would they say “thanks, I wish I’d thought of putting it that way”?

People have to organize images manually now and it can be automated easily. There is APIs for this tech, provided by cloud giants (Google, MS, Amazon), but they only provide labels for given image, not a search service. Developers have to build and configure Elastic Search instances, then hook recognition APIs with Elastic by growing their existing codebase, probably being have to refactor lots of models, just for this feature.

#### What are you building for them?

A service and SDK for building image search engines effortlessly.

#### Write a tweet from a hypothetical customer explaining the product and how it eliminates their dissatisfaction.

"We could focus on our actual product instead of organizing photos / building search for our photos"

#### Write a blog post title for your product launch. Is it surprising? Is it new? Will your target customers want to click on it? Will they want to share the link? Will they still share it the next day?
