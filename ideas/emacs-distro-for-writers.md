# Emacs Distro Just for Writing

I now realize that the right way to build an Emacs configuration is to start from setting it up just for writing. If I had enough free time, I'd start an Emacs with default mode set for writing-mode, where margins are set for having text on center (not aligned to center, just big block of spacing on sides), bigger font sizes, typo checking, no line numbers, nothing related to coding, absolute focus mode on writing.

Then I'd add some rules for enabling coding mode if the user is opening a source code.
